In Next.js 14, the differences between route handlers and server actions are as follows:

1. **Purpose**:
   - **Route Handlers**: Route handlers are used to handle API requests in Next.js. They are typically used to create custom API endpoints that can be consumed by the client-side application or other external services.
   - **Server Actions**: Server actions are a feature introduced in Next.js 13, and they are primarily used to handle form submissions and other user interactions that require server-side processing.

2. **Location**:
   - **Route Handlers**: Route handlers are defined in the `pages/api` directory of a Next.js project.
   - **Server Actions**: Server actions are defined in the `app` directory of a Next.js 14 project, typically in the same directory as the component that uses the action.

3. **Syntax**:
   - **Route Handlers**: Route handlers are defined as standard Next.js API routes, using the `export default function handler(req, res)` syntax.
   - **Server Actions**: Server actions are defined using the `export const action = async ({ request }) => { ... }` syntax.

4. **Request Handling**:
   - **Route Handlers**: Route handlers receive the full `NextApiRequest` and `NextApiResponse` objects, allowing for more granular control over the request and response.
   - **Server Actions**: Server actions receive a simplified `request` object, which includes the request body, headers, and other relevant data. The response is handled automatically by Next.js.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - **Route Handlers**: In route handlers, you need to handle errors manually and set the appropriate HTTP status code in the response.
   - **Server Actions**: Server actions automatically handle errors and return the appropriate HTTP status code based on the error.

6. **Client-side Integration**:
   - **Route Handlers**: Client-side code needs to make a separate API request to the route handler, typically using a library like `fetch` or `axios`.
   - **Server Actions**: Server actions are integrated directly with the client-side component, allowing for a more seamless user experience. The client-side code can call the server action directly, and Next.js will handle the communication between the client and the server.

The main difference in Next.js 14 is the introduction of the `app` directory, which is the new recommended way to structure Next.js applications. In this new structure, server actions are defined in the `app` directory, while route handlers are still defined in the `pages/api` directory.

Additionally, Next.js 14 introduces a new feature called "Layouts", which allows you to define reusable layout components in the `app` directory. These layouts can be used to wrap server actions, providing a more consistent and cohesive user experience.

**Also:**

- _Server Actions_ generally refer to operations or tasks that are executed on the server-side in response to a client request.
- In the context of Next.js, _routing handlers_ could be functions that are triggered when a specific route is accessed.
